With over 17 years of experience in **software development**, I have worked with leading tech companies and advertising agencies across Mexico, the USA and beyond.

As a developer, I have built applications using:

- **Elixir**, **Ruby on Rails** and **PHP** for back-end development
- **JavaScript** for web and hybrid mobile apps
- **Objective-C** and **Swift** for iOS and macOS development

Currently, I work as a **Mobile Engineering Manager** at [Boletia](https://github.com/boletia).
